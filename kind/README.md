# `kind` - **K**ubernetes **IN** **D**ocker

## WARNING: `kind` is still a work in progress! See [docs/todo.md][todo]

`kind` is a toolset for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container "nodes".
`kind` is designed to be suitable for testing Kubernetes, initially targeting the conformance suite.

It consists of:
 - Go [packages][packages] implementing [cluster creation][cluster package], [image build][build package], etc.
 - A command line interface ([`kind`][kind cli]) built on these packages.
 - Docker [image(s)][images] written to run systemd, Kubernetes, etc.
 - [`kubetest`][kubetest] integration also built on these packages (WIP)

Kind bootstraps each "node" with [kubeadm][kubeadm].

For more details see [the design documentation][design doc].

## Building

You can install `kind` with `go install k8s.io/test-infra/kind`.

## Usage

`kind create` will create a cluster.

`kind delete` will delete a cluster.

For more usage, run `kind --help` or `kind [command] --help`.

## Advanced

`kind build base` will build the base image.

`kind build node` will build the node image.
